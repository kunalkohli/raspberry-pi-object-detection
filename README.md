# raspberry-pi-image-detection
This repository will help in setting up a object detection project using raspberry pi as the engine running image classifier as well as a flask web server to host the video stream.

Tesnorflow lite is being used to run the image classification part. A camera installed on a raspberry pi captures a video streamat 15FPS. For each frame it sends the image to neural engine to get a calssification for the image in the view.


More details to follow. Stay Tuned
